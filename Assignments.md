## Practice:

- Write a function that finds sum of square of all elements in a vector
- Read and practice filter operation
- Read about function docstring and add docstring for the function you have just written
- Solve the first problem of project euler https://projecteuler.net/problem=1

## To get a conceptual grasp:

- Read further about immutable datastructures
- Read further about pure functions
