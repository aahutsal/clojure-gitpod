## End Notes:
- Post your feebacks for improvement and what you look forward in the meetup page.
- Take time to practice the assignments. 
- If you come from an imperative style of programming, some degree of difficulty is expected. The difficulty is common and it is nothing to do with your ability to learn Clojure.
- Make use of the `#beginners` channel in  [clojurians.net slack](http://clojurians.net).
- The suggestions we recieve from you will be one of the driving factor for the upcoming sessions.
